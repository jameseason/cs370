  abstract = {The article discusses critical large systems projects, examining the reasons behind the success or failure of such endeavors and exploring how to do them better. Examples of such projects are provided including the failure of the replacement FAA (U.S. Federal Aviation Administration) air traffic control system to deliver the functions needed and the success of the Boeing 777 aircraft. Also discussed is the importance for development time to be shorter than environmental change time and evolutionary creation of the Internet.},
